Solar has a learning rate of 23%. Total capacity in 2020 is 770GW. We expect cumulative capacity of solar to reach 30-70TW by 2050. 

This means that if it reaches 70TW, it will have doubled 6.5 times. If it reaches 30TW, it will have doubled 5.28 times. 

This means that if it reaches 70TW, we expect the price of solar to be 0.18 what it is now. 
If it reaches 30TW, we expect the price to be 0.25 what it is now


In recent years, solar has had a learning rate of 40%. 

70TW capacity then corresponds to a price of 0.036 what it is now, while 30TW capacity corresponds to 0.067 what it is now



Applying these to the present day cost of 529,000 EUR/MW for solar, assuming present day learning rate (40%):
 19,044 EUR/MW (70TW), 35,443 EUR/MW (30TW)


Assuming historical learning rate of solar: 95,000 EUR/MW (70TW), or 132,250 EUR/MW (30TW)
